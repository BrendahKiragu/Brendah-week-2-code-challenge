README.md for Interactive Shopping List Code Challenge
# Overview
This code challenge focuses on combining array iteration, DOM manipulation, and event handling to develop an interactive shopping list application. Participants will enhance their skills in JavaScript by creating a functional webpage that allows users to manage a shopping list effectively.

# Objective
The goal is to build a webpage featuring a shopping list where users can perform various actions such as adding items, marking items as purchased, and clearing the entire list.

# Requirements
## Array
Maintain a JavaScript array to store shopping list items. This array should be updated whenever an item is added, marked as purchased, or removed.

DOM Manipulation

## Create an HTML structure consisting of:
1. An input field for entering new items.
2. A list container (<ul>) to display the items.
3. Buttons labeled "Add", "Mark Purchased", and "Clear List".

## JAVASCRIPT DOM MANIPULATION
### Create a function that:
1. Dynamically adds new items to the list container upon clicking the "Add" button. These additions should reflect in the DOM but not necessarily persist across page refreshes.
2. Visually indicate purchased items by applying a strikethrough effect or changing the background color.

### Event Handling
- Attach an event listener to the "Add" button to capture user input and add items to the list.
- Implement event listeners on the list of items to allow users to mark them as purchased.
- Attach an event listener to the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.

### Bonus Features
Creates a function that:
* Allow users to edit existing list items by providing an interface for modification.
* Implement persistence using local storage to ensure the list remains intact even after the page reloads.

# Learning outcome
Through this challenge I got to :
- Practice iterating through arrays to access and manipulate list items.
- Gain hands-on experience in dynamically modifying the DOM based on user interactions.
- Reinforce their understanding of event listeners and their role in creating interactive web applications.
